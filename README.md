Text Case Converter

Introduction:

This project implements a text case converter that intelligently changes the case of text inputted by the user. It utilizes basic string manipulation and ASCII character handling to identify and convert the first character of each word to the opposite case (uppercase to lowercase and vice versa), while leaving the rest of the text unchanged.

Skills Used:

String manipulation
ASCII character handling
Basic control flow and conditional statements
Modular programming (using functions from a different file)
